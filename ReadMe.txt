The goal of this project is to convert numbers into all their possible formats.

For example, If you want to be able to Read Star Wars VII with the String Star Wars 7 or Star Wars Seven. It should be simple and easy. 

But thinking bigger than this, there are other languages, multiple syntaxes and more. Wouldn't it be awesome to be able to read them all with ease. 

Currently this project has a way to find and convert strings with numbers from English Words, Roman Numerals, and Digits. But there is so much more to be explored and probably many other little features that weren't needed at the time of construction. So, contribute and let's make something great together. 

You are free to take and distribute this code in any way you want.
